## ChallengeWeek1
This repository contains the solutions to the Challenge Week 1.


### What was the challenge?
The challenge was to write bash scripts that does the following tasks:
* Creates a new group on the Linux system
* Creates a new user
* Adds the new user to the group
* Creates a file called `run.sh`
* Enters an echo command to that file.
* Makes that file executable only by members of your new group
* Switch to you new user
* Runs your `run.sh` script.

Essentially, you are creating an automated script that has a set of commands to create the user,  group and join the user to group and set permissions and finally print out a message from another user's account. For example, I have created a user called james from my default account that runs a script file called run.sh to display the message Heelo World!

### How I expected the challenge to go.
The challenge was super fun, engaging but also a little challenging in the end. I had great fun took longer than anticipated. If more time than would have completed the bonus task.

### What went well?
It was easy to understand what was required. The task started of on a easy note and then slowly got harder. The task pushes you hard to know and understand the concepts really well given on the QA community. 

### What didn't go as planned?
I was aiming to finish the bonus task too but more time had to be delivered in the first task that did not allow me to progress further. Also having other work requirements meant I had less time than given on the project.

### Possible improvements for future challenges.
Maybe talk through the challenge on the teams call so any questions from the participants can be resolved. 

Thank you.
